    Funtion structure:

        def functionname(paremeter list):
            statement(s)

    Functions have to be declared before they can be used

    If you want funciton to accept data, then put info in between the parenthesis
        data is passed to funtions by using parameters

    If you want function to return data, then use a return statement in the body of the function

    In order to use a function, call the funtion by using its name, and matching parameters

    print("This is a quick demo of cuntions")
    print("We will now call the greeting funtion")
